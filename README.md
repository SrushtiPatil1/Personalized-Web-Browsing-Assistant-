# Personalized Web Browsing Assistant

## üìå Project Overview
In the era of **information overload**, it is difficult for users to get relevant information quickly. The **Personalized Web Browsing Assistant** helps users by recommending websites based on their **browsing history** and interests.  

This project implements a **User-Based Collaborative Filtering Recommender System**, where recommendations are generated by finding **similarities between users** and their browsing patterns.
